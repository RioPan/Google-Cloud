This project repository is created in partial fulfillment of the requirements fro the Big Data Analytics course offered by the Master of Science in Business Analytics program at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota. 

## Abstract

Quick decision making is probably one of the most important abilities for business today. In a 10-year research program performed by Bain & Company, it was found that high performing companies are making decisions quicker and more efficiently compared to their worse-performed competitors. Also, another article by Forbes found that 84% of marketing organizations were implementing or expanding AI and machine learning in 2018. Google Cloud provides a unified platform with two ready-made tools to enable quick decision making and automatic machine learning. 

Quick decision making requires up-to-date information and the Twitter API Toolkit built into Google Cloud is a prebuilt pipeline to ingest streaming Tweets. What once took a developer over 60 hours to build a custom solution, now can be done in 60 minutes. 

Once data is ingested, Google AutoML provides a mechanism for users to apply machine learning models to data with just a few clicks of the mouse, no coding is required. 

We accomplished real-time streaming and machine learning analysis using the Twitter API, Pub/Sub, AutoML, and Looker Studio in the Google Cloud Platform. In our Demo, we ingest Tweets about Apple using the Twitter API Tooklkit, Pub/Sub and Google BigQuery, then, we feed the data into AutoML and make batch predictions using a trained model for sentiment analysis. Lastly, through Looker Studio we create a real-time dashboard to monitor customersâ€™ comments and sentiment analysis about the company and products.


DataSet sources: Twitter 1.6 Million Sentiment Analysis dataset on Kaggle 
Tools/Technology used: Google Cloud Pub/Sub, Big Query, AutoML(Vertex AI), Looker Studio

## Instructions

Most of this project was completed with little to no-code. After creating a Google Cloud account the two major steps can be completed by following the instructions below.
